# Calorie_Prediction_kaggle

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook and datasets for predicting calorie-related values using machine learning with train and test data.

## Files

- `Calorie_Prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with data loading, model training, hyperparameter tuning (using GridSearchCV), and prediction.
- `train.csv` — Training dataset.
- `test.csv` — Test dataset.
- `submission.csv` — Predicted results for the test dataset (if applicable).

## How to Use

- Open and run `Calorie_Prediction.ipynb` to see the full process from data preparation to prediction.
- The notebook was created and tested in the Kaggle environment.
- No additional parameters or setup are needed.

## Notes

- The data is clean and contains no missing values (NaNs).
- The project uses GridSearchCV to find the best model parameters.
- This project is generic and not related to any specific topic like diabetes.
